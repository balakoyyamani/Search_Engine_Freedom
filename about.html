	<b><h1 align="center" style="font-size:35px;" >ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1></b>
	<p style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provided code appears to be an HTML document that represents a website. Here is a breakdown of its structure:

		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The first section includes the HTML, head, and body tags, which define the basic structure of the web page.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The head section contains the title element, which specifies the title of the web page. It also includes links to external CSS stylesheets, such as "sparx.css," <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nike.css," "contact.css," and "danger.css." These CSS files define the styles for different elements of the web page.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Inside the body section, there are several divisions (div) that define different sections of the website.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The first division with the class "wrapper" contains a navigation bar (nav) with a logo image (img) and an unordered list (ul) that represents the menu items. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each menu item is a list item (li) with an anchor (a) tag for linking to different pages or sections of the website.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The next division contains a heading (h1) with the text "CHOOSE YOUR COMFORT" aligned at the center.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Following the heading, there are multiple anchor (a) tags wrapped around images (img). These images serve as links to various search engines such as Google,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brave, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Dogpile, Startpage, AOL, Lycos, Swisscows, WebCrawler, WolframAlpha, Gigablast, Mojeek, Yandex, Ecosia, Qwant, Searx, Yippy, and Metager.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. After that, there is another division with the class "center" that contains a heading (h1), buttons, and an image<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -container. This section is related <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the<b>"IB<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -TECH"</b> part of the website.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The image<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -container contains multiple images (img) with different sources (src) and alt attributes. These images may represent different sections or features of the website.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The code also includes separate HTML sections for the "CONTACT" and "Feedback" pages. Each section contains its own HTML structure, including headings, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraphs, and contact information.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Finally, there are CSS styles defined within style tags that customize the appearance of the website elements such as the navigation bar, logo, headings,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buttons, and image container.
		
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this code represents a basic website with multiple sections, a navigation bar, images, and links to different pages or external websites.</p>
